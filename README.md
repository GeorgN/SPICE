# SPICE
SPICE stands for **S**iLA **P**rovider **I**mplementation **C**ommunity **E**quipment.

Idea is to have a public open source available base for a SiLA ServiceProvider to simplify the entrance to the SiLA World / SiLA Device integration for device manufacturer. And if the interest is high enough there will also be the power in future to enhance SPICE and adapt to changed SiLA DCDIS / DCIS versions.

SPICE can be used as *SiLAConverter* like the developer *ILT Institute for Lab Automation and Mechatronics* to equip legacy devices with a SiLA Interface or it can by use by device manufacturer to fully integrate a SiLA Interface within their devices.

An implementation based on SPICE would be called a SPI (**S**iLA **P**rovider **I**mplementation) like the also open source available *SPI_Multidrop*.

## Language / Requirements
As one of the unique open source libraries SPICE is written in C++. This is to get a better possibility for device manufacturer to integrate a SiLA Interface within their devices.
* C++ 11
* Platform supporting multiple threads

## SiLA Version
SPICE 1.0 implements the SiLA DCDIS 1.3.08 specification.

## Features
**Standard:**
* Full implementation of the state machine
* Automatic command handling (synchronous responses, get parameters and check limits, error handling communication, response communication)
* Command buffering supported
* Parallel command execution supported
* Implementation of all mandatory commands
* Implementation of some common commands
* Automatic WSDL-file generation
* WSDiscovery supported

**Programming:**
* Modular structure.
* Modules are just connected over interfaces and base classes.
* Possibility to replace the EthernetServer and XMLParser with other implementations based on other libraries. (Currently available implementation uses the POCO-libraries).
* Possibility to replace the Core with a slim version without features like command buffering and parallel command execution. (Not available yet. Could be generated as there are enough requests)
* Base classes for commands. You just have to derivate and implement the methods.
* Classes for DataTypes and DataSets to easy work with parameters and configuration sets.

**Multiple devices:**
* One application can have multiple instances of the core to provide more than one SiLA device. They have to differ over there URI-Paths. This feature is interesting for SiLAConverters with legacy devices to support more than one device with only one SiLAConverter hardware.
* One Core can be registered at different EthernetServer to support multiple ports or HTTP and HTTPS at the same time.

**Organizational:**
* Template project available
* Real implementation as example available (SPI_Multidrop)
* Tested with different Process Management Systems

## Missing
* Autoreset after timeout
* DataEvent generation
* Special DataTypes

## Possible features in future
* Additional EthernetServer and XMLParser implementations based on other libraries to get a choice.
* EthernetServer with HTTPS-support.
* Optional extension field to error events.
* Better / easier ResponseData generation.
* General logging system
